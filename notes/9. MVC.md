# Model View Controller

- Model

Responsible for data management and business logic. It interacts with the database and handles data validation and business rules. Models define the structure of the data and the relationships between different pieces of data.
- View

Represents the user interface or frontend of the application. The view is responsible for presenting data to the user and may include HTML templates, user input forms, or any visual representation of the data. Essentially, itâ€™s what the user sees.
- Controller

Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It receives user input from the view, processes it (often involving the model), and determines which view should be displayed. The controller manages the flow of data and application logic.
