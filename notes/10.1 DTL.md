# Django Template Language

we don't have to escape when using a templating language because whatever is written in double curly braces is escaped by default.

a filter can be applied to data using pipe symbol `|`.

so if we don't want templating language to escape we can use safe filter:<br>
`{{ data_var|safe }}`

### Calling Code
{% url 'cat-detail' cat.id %}
{% author.get_absolute_url %}

### Logic
if, loop

### Block
to put code from other file

---
Disclaimer: A very nice example coming through!

**views.py**
```
def loop(request):
    f = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'guava']
    n = ['peanut', 'cashew']
    context = {'fruits': f, 'nuts': n}

    return render(request, app_name/loop.html)
```
**loop.html**
```
<ul>
    {% for x in fruits %}
    <li>{{x}}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

{% if nuts %}
    <p>There are {{nuts|length}} nuts</p>
{% else %}
    <p>There are no nuts</p>
{% endif %}
```
<br>
`x = { "outer": {"inner": 20} }`<br>
The value in dict can be another dict and its items can be accessed with a dot notation:<br>
`{{ outer.inner }}`

## Template Inheritance

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

we'll create a base template like:
```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </body>
</html>
```
usage:
```
{% extends "app_name/base.htm" %}

{% block title %}File 1{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>This is a web page</h1>
{% endblock %}
```

## Reversing django views and urls

its basically the names that we give to our routes. and in project urls.py we can give namespaces for same reason and that can be used later to use that route instead of typing whole path
