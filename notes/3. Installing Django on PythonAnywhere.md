# Installing Django on PythonAnywhere

## PythonAnywhere
PythonAnywhere is a hosting enviornment

### Consoles
Access the only free machine provided by pythonAnywhere through bash

### Files
You can see and edit files on your remote system

### Web
To basically host your app

## Create a virtual enviornment
(I was already familiar with linux commands, so not mentioning those here)

run `mkvirtualenv django5`. it will create and activate the enviornment. Download django there through pip. (I am personally using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)). Just make sure you are in the created enviornment, there will be (django5) written before the bash prompt.

If you want this env to be actvated by default when you open bash, just add `workon django5` at the end of the .bashrc file.

can't use sudo here ðŸ¥², so python or uv venv will not work here

## First Django Project

1. Created a directory (django_projects)
2. created a project (mysite): `django-admin startproject mysite`
3. In home/_username_/django_projects/mysite/mysite/**settings.py** added `*` in allowed hosts e.g. `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']`
    - here **_python manage.py runserver_** will not work since its not your local machine and you will be accessing it through a valid url. Just run **_python manage.py check_** and it will let you know if you have any errors.
4. on PythonAnywhere go to **Web** tab
    - go to code section, in `source code` and `working directory` paste the path of your project and similarly the virtual env path.
    - edit WSGI in code section and put only this code in there, delete the one which is there (use nano, vi or the file tab of pythonAnywhere):
    ```
        import os
        import sys

        path = os.path.expanduser('~/django_projects/mysite')
        if path not in sys.path:
            sys.path.insert(0, path)
        os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'
        from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
        from django.contrib.staticfiles.handlers import StaticFilesHandler
        application = StaticFilesHandler(get_wsgi_application())
    ```
5. click on "Reload _username_.pythonanywhere.com" on start of the page

and voila your first project is ready to be viewed on web anywhere through the link in point 5

### Creating an app within project

**Note:** After any change you make do the "check" thing (point 3 above) and reload (point 5 above)
1. create an app: `python manage.py startapp polls`
2. Creating our first view: cd into this app directory and edit views.py, it should look something like this:
    ```
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    def polls_main(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, world. 86a8f059 is the polls index.")
    ```
3. Adding route that will show the view created earlier. create urls.py in polls (This urls.py is local to polls app)
    ```
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path("", views.polls_main, name="polls-index"),
    ]
    ```
4. edit urls.py in main project, which means you have to come back one step and go into the folder named same as project name (basically where we edited the settings.py, this urls.py is the main one at project level):
    ```
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path("polls/", include('polls.urls')),
        path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    ]
    ```
5. Now just reload the web app and you should be able to access the newly created app through the link: *url*.com/polls

**Note**: once you change the routes in project level urls.py, you will not see the default django page on base route (*url*.com/) and you'll get 404 error if you try to access root

**Note**: `/` is the root or starting point of your path

Lets try to understand what happened here. routes are basically like file path that we have to define here. in main or project level **urls.py** we have added the "polls/" path which should lead to some view but here its going to another urls.py which is local urls.py of polls app.

Ok, now lets go to polls' urls. here blank (equivalent to root) path is leading to the view that we creaetd which is returning http response. Just keep in mind that normally url.com/ is the base path but in this case url.com/polls/ is the base path for our app.

But I want to have multiple apps and project's base path or root should show hyperlinks to all apps. For that I will create another app named proj_base and i will add urls.py similarly there. `""` path in project level urls will lead to urls of proj_base and there blank path will return the view that contains home page of the project.
